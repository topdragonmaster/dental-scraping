### Objectives

Your main objective is to implement some methods of your choice in the
`HenryScheinScrapingExercises`, `MidwestDentalScrapingExercises`, and
`DatabaseExercises` classes so that the corresponding tests pass.

### Hints

All exercises can be solved using the packages and utilities already installed
and provided with this repository. You can find some examples on how to use them
[here](./src/support/examples.spec.ts). You may install and use additional npm
packages, provided you still comply with the instructions of each exercise.
Check out the `scripts` section of `package.json` for additional tools and
utilities.

The repository contains a SQLite database (`.src/support/store.db`), which is
pre-populated with some tables and pseudo-random data. Being able to inspect the
database and understand its schema is part of the test.
